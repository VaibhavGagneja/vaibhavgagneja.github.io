If you've ever pulled an `ubuntu` or `alpine` Docker image and wondered — *"Why is my container 100MB when my app is only 5MB?"* — you've stumbled onto one of the most important questions in container security.

The answer is **Distroless images** — a radical rethinking of what a container actually needs to contain. And to understand them, you need to understand something most developers get wrong: **the difference between the OS, the Shell, and the Kernel.**

This guide breaks it all down from first principles, just the way a senior engineer would explain it during a real code review.

---

## 1. The Problem: What's Actually Inside Your Container?

Let's start with what a standard container image looks like:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        STANDARD IMAGE (e.g., ubuntu:22.04)                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                │
│  Your Application ................... 5 MB   ← You need this  │
│  Runtime (Python/Node/JRE) ......... 40 MB   ← You need this  │
│  CA Certificates ................... 0.2 MB  ← You need this  │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────                 │
│  bash, sh, zsh .................... 5 MB    ← You DON'T       │
│  apt, dpkg, apt-get ............... 10 MB   ← You DON'T       │
│  ls, grep, find, cat, curl ........ 15 MB   ← You DON'T       │
│  vim, nano, perl, python2 ......... 25 MB   ← You DON'T       │
│  man pages, docs, locales ......... 20 MB   ← You DON'T       │
│                                                                │
│  TOTAL: ~120 MB                                                │
│  ACTUALLY NEEDED: ~45 MB                                       │
│  WASTE: ~75 MB of tools no running container ever uses!        │
│                                                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

That's 75 MB of tools sitting inside your container that **nobody uses in production** — not your app, not the runtime, nobody. They exist only because someone might want to `docker exec` into the container and poke around.

And here's the kicker: **every one of those unused tools is a potential security vulnerability.**

---

## 2. What Are Distroless Images?

**Distroless images** are container images that contain **only your application and its runtime dependencies**. Everything else — the shell, the package manager, the standard Unix utilities — is stripped out.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          DISTROLESS IMAGE (e.g., gcr.io/distroless/base)      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                │
│  Your Application ................... 5 MB   ← Included ✅    │
│  Runtime (Python/Node/JRE) ......... 40 MB   ← Included ✅    │
│  CA Certificates ................... 0.2 MB  ← Included ✅    │
│  Timezone Data ..................... 0.3 MB  ← Included ✅    │
│  Core System Libraries (glibc) ..... 2 MB    ← Included ✅    │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────                 │
│  Shell (bash, sh) .................. NONE ❌                   │
│  Package Manager (apt, apk) ........ NONE ❌                   │
│  Utilities (ls, grep, curl) ........ NONE ❌                   │
│                                                                │
│  TOTAL: ~48 MB                                                 │
│                                                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The name "distroless" literally means **"without a Linux distribution."** You get the machine-level libraries your app needs, but none of the human-facing tools that make a Linux system feel like a Linux system.

### Who Maintains Them?

Distroless images are maintained by two major projects:

| Provider | Registry | Focus |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Google** (GoogleContainerTools) | `gcr.io/distroless/...` | Debian-based, widely adopted |
| **Chainguard** | `cgr.dev/chainguard/...` | Alpine/wolfi-based, bleeding-edge security |

Both follow the same philosophy: **minimum viable container.**

## 3. "But Wait — How Does the App Run Without an OS?"

This is the question that trips up almost everyone. And it reveals a fundamental misunderstanding about what an "Operating System" actually is.

The short answer: **Your application does not need a shell to run. It only needs the Kernel.**

### The Shell Is Just an App

We think of the Shell (`bash`, `sh`, `zsh`) as the "boss" of the computer because that's how *we humans* interact with it. But to the computer, **the Shell is just another application** — exactly like Microsoft Word or your Python script.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           THE SHELL IS JUST ANOTHER PROGRAM                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                │
│  When you type: python myapp.py                                │
│                                                                │
│  1. You (human) ──► Shell (bash)                               │
│     "Hey bash, start Python please"                            │
│                                                                │
│  2. Shell (bash) ──► Kernel                                    │
│     "Hey Kernel, please execute /usr/bin/python with           │
│      argument myapp.py"                                        │
│                                                                │
│  3. Kernel ──► Python starts running                           │
│     The Shell now just WAITS. It's not "running" your code.   │
│     The KERNEL is running Python directly.                     │
│                                                                │
│  The Shell was just a TRANSLATOR between you and the Kernel.  │
│  If there's no human typing commands... you don't need it!    │
│                                                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Real "OS" Is the Kernel

The actual Operating System is the **Linux Kernel**. It sits on the **host machine** (the server, the VM, your laptop). Here's the critical distinction:

| Component | What It Does | Needed by Apps? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Kernel** | Manages CPU, memory, hardware, network, filesystem | ✅ **Yes — always** |
| **Shell** (`bash`, `sh`) | Lets humans type commands | ❌ **No — computers don't type** |
| **Package Manager** (`apt`, `apk`) | Lets humans install software | ❌ **No — container is pre-built** |
| **Utilities** (`ls`, `grep`, `curl`) | Lets humans explore the filesystem | ❌ **No — the app already knows its files** |

### The Key Insight: Containers Share the Host Kernel

In the VM world, every VM has **its own kernel**. In the Docker world, containers **share the host's kernel**.

│  Each VM: ~GB overhead         Each Container: ~MB overhead   │
│                                                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Your distroless container's Python app says "write a file" → the Python runtime translates this into a **System Call** → the system call goes directly to the **Host Kernel** → the Host Kernel writes the file. **No shell involved at any point.**

## 4. The Restaurant Analogy

Think of this like a **restaurant**:

| Restaurant | Computer |
|-----------|----------|
| **The Kitchen** (cooks the food) | **The Kernel** (does the actual work) |
| **The Waiter** (takes your order, relays it to the kitchen) | **The Shell** (takes your commands, relays to kernel) |
| **You** (the customer) | **The Human User** |

Normally, you (Customer) tell the Waiter (Shell) what you want, and the Waiter tells the Kitchen (Kernel).

In a **Distroless** setup, you use a **Digital Ordering Kiosk (Docker)**. The kiosk sends the order directly to the Kitchen. The Waiter is fired because there's no human inside the container placing orders — but the Kitchen still cooks everything exactly the same way.

```

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 5. The Stack Inside a Distroless Container

To make this concrete, here's exactly what exists inside a distroless container at each layer:

| Layer | Component | Who Provides It? |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Top** | Your Code (e.g., `main.py`, `app.jar`) | **You** (copied into the image) |
| **Middle** | Runtime + Libraries (e.g., Python, `glibc`, `libssl`) | **Distroless image** (Google/Chainguard) |
| ~~Gap~~ | ~~The Shell used to be here~~ | ~~Removed — not needed~~ |
| **Bottom** | The Linux Kernel | **The Host Machine** (AWS, GCP, your laptop) |

The image is **not empty**. It has the machine libraries your app needs to talk to the Kernel. It just doesn't have the *human tools* that a shell-based workflow requires:

- **Kept:** `libc.so`, `libssl.so`, `ca-certificates`, `tzdata`
- **Removed:** `ls`, `cd`, `mv`, `bash`, `nano`, `apt-get`, `curl`

---

## 6. How Docker Starts Your App (The Mechanics)

Here's the exact sequence of events when you start a distroless container. No magic, just system calls:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         HOW DOCKER STARTS A DISTROLESS CONTAINER               │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                │
│  Dockerfile says:                                              │
│    ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]                                       │
│                                                                │
│  Step 1: Docker daemon reads the ENTRYPOINT instruction        │
│                                                                │
│  Step 2: Docker creates a new isolated namespace               │
│          (network, PID, mount, etc.)                           │
│                                                                │
│  Step 3: Docker makes a system call to the Host Kernel:        │
│          execve("/myapp", ["/myapp"], env_vars)                │
│                                                                │
│  Step 4: The Host Kernel:                                      │
│          → Loads /myapp into memory                            │
│          → Creates a new process (PID 1 inside the container) │
│          → Starts executing CPU instructions                   │
│                                                                │
│  ✅ At NO POINT was bash, sh, or any shell involved!           │
│  ✅ Docker acted as the "launcher" instead of a shell          │
│                                                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The Docker daemon talks directly to the Kernel using the `execve` system call. This is the same call that the Shell *would have* used — Docker just cuts out the middleman.

---

## 7. Exec Form vs Shell Form — The Syntax That Changes Everything

This is a detail that bites developers hard when they first use distroless images, and it's critical to understand:

### The Two Forms

```dockerfile
# ❌ SHELL FORM — Secretly uses a shell!
ENTRYPOINT php /app/catfact.php

# ✅ EXEC FORM — Talks directly to the Kernel!
ENTRYPOINT ["php", "/app/catfact.php"]
```

The difference looks tiny — just some brackets and quotes — but the behavior is **completely different**:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            SHELL FORM vs EXEC FORM                             │

│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐         │

│  │  In Distroless: ✅ Works perfectly!               │         │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘         │
│                                                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why PID 1 Matters

When you stop a container (`docker stop` or Ctrl+C), Docker sends a `SIGTERM` signal to **PID 1** — the main process.

| Form | PID 1 | Signal Handling |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Shell Form** | `/bin/sh` (the shell) | Shell often **ignores** SIGTERM. Your app keeps running. Docker force-kills after 10 seconds. ⚠️ |
| **Exec Form** | Your app (e.g., `php`) | Your app **receives** SIGTERM directly. Can close DB connections, save state, shut down cleanly. ✅ |

> **Rule of thumb:** Always use the exec form `["..."]` in Dockerfiles. It's not just a distroless requirement — it's a best practice for **all** containers.

## 8. Multi-Stage Builds — The Pattern That Makes It Work

You can't install dependencies inside a distroless image because there's no package manager. So how do you get your app and its libraries in there?

The answer: **Multi-Stage Docker Builds.** You use a "heavy" image to *build* your app, then copy *only* the result into a distroless image.

### The General Pattern

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              MULTI-STAGE BUILD PATTERN                         │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐              │

│  └──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┘              │
│                         │ COPY --from=builder                  │
│                         ▼                                      │

│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐              │

│  │  → Contains ONLY the built artifact          │              │
│  │  → No compilers, no git, no shell            │              │
│  │  → This is what gets deployed!               │              │

│  Build tools stay in Stage 1 (never shipped to production!)   │
│                                                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Example: Go Application

Go compiles to a **static binary** — the simplest case for distroless:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: The Build Environment (Heavy)
FROM golang:1.21 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
# Build a static binary — no external dependencies needed
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o myapp main.go

# Stage 2: The Production Environment (Distroless)
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12
# Copy ONLY the binary from Stage 1
COPY --from=build /app/myapp /
# Exec form — no shell needed
CMD ["/myapp"]
```

**Result:** A container that's often **under 10 MB** and contains literally nothing except your binary and root certificates.

### Example: Java Application

Java needs the JRE at runtime:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build with Maven
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Run with Distroless Java
FROM gcr.io/distroless/java21-debian12
COPY --from=build /app/target/myapp.jar /app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

### Example: Python Application

Python needs the interpreter at runtime:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Install dependencies
FROM python:3.12-slim AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --target=/app/deps -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Run with Distroless Python
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app /app
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app/deps
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/main.py"]
```

### Example: Node.js Application

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Install dependencies + build
FROM node:20-slim AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Run with Distroless Node
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app /app
CMD ["index.js"]
```

---

## 9. Real-World Example: Chainguard PHP Image

Here's a production-ready Dockerfile using **Chainguard** images (an alternative to Google's Distroless). This pattern shows *exactly* why two stages exist:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: The "-dev" image (has build tools)
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest-dev AS builder

# Chainguard images run as non-root by default (security!)
USER root
COPY . /app
RUN chown -R php /app
USER php

# Composer needs: network, git, unzip — all available in -dev
RUN cd /app && \
    composer install --no-progress --no-dev --prefer-dist

# Stage 2: The production image (NO build tools)
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/php:latest

# Copy the built app (code + vendor/) from Stage 1
COPY --from=builder /app /app

# Direct execution — no shell startup script
ENTRYPOINT ["php", "/app/catfact.php"]
```

### Breaking It Down

| Stage | Image | Has Shell? | Has Composer? | Has Git? | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Builder** | `php:latest-dev` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Download dependencies, prepare the app |
| **Production** | `php:latest` | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Run the app — nothing else |

The `-dev` suffix is the convention across Chainguard images. It means "this image includes the developer tools." The non-`-dev` version is the production-ready, minimal image.

> **Why does this matter for security?** If a hacker exploits your PHP app in production, they can't `composer require malicious-package` (no Composer), they can't `git clone malware-repo` (no Git), and they can't `bash -c 'download_cryptominer'` (no bash). The attack surface is drastically reduced.

---

## 10. Why Use Distroless? The Security Mechanics

The primary reason is **Attack Surface Reduction**. Let's see how this works concretely:

### Scenario: Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability

Your app has a bug that lets an attacker run arbitrary commands (this happens — even to companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google).

```

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The CVE Advantage

Security scanners like **Trivy**, **Snyk**, or **Docker Scout** scan every package in your container image for known vulnerabilities (CVEs). More packages = more CVEs.

| Image Type | Typical Packages | Typical CVEs | Noise Level |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `ubuntu:22.04` | 100+ | 50-200+ | 🔴 WAY too many to track |
| `alpine:3.18` | 20-30 | 10-30 | 🟡 Better, but still noisy |
| `distroless/static` | 2-3 | 0-3 | 🟢 Only real issues |

Most CVEs in standard images are in packages like `perl`, `libsystemd`, or `openssl` *CLI tools* — things your app never touches. But they still show up in audit reports, and your security team still has to triage them.

With distroless, **every CVE that appears is actually relevant to your application.**

---

## 11. The Trade-Offs: Size, Security, and Debugging

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Standard Image (`ubuntu`/`alpine`) | Distroless Image |
|---------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Shell** | ✅ Yes (`bash`, `sh`) | ❌ None |
| **Package Manager** | ✅ Yes (`apt`, `apk`, `yum`) | ❌ None |
| **Typical Size** | 20 MB – 150 MB+ | 2 MB – 25 MB |
| **Security Scanning** | Many extraneous packages | Only app dependencies |
| **CVE Noise** | 🔴 High | 🟢 Low |
| **Attack Surface** | Large (shell, curl, wget available) | Minimal |
| **Debugging** | Easy (`docker exec -it ... bash`) | Hard (requires special techniques) |
| **Build Complexity** | Simple (one stage) | Moderate (multi-stage required) |

### The Debugging Problem

This is the main trade-off. Since there's no shell inside, you **cannot** run:

```bash
# ❌ This WILL NOT work with distroless
docker exec -it my-container sh
docker exec -it my-container bash
```

There's nothing to exec into. The container has one process: your application. That's it.

So how do you debug?

---

## 12. Debugging Distroless Containers

### Strategy 1: The `:debug` Tag

Both Google and Chainguard provide **debug variants** of their images that include a lightweight [BusyBox](https://busybox.net/) shell:

```dockerfile
# Development/Staging — has a shell for debugging
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12:debug

# Production — no shell, maximum security
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12
```

```bash
# Now you CAN exec into the debug variant:
docker exec -it my-container /busybox/sh
```

> **Best Practice:** Use `:debug` in development and staging. Use the standard (non-debug) tag in production. You can control this with a build argument:

```dockerfile
ARG IMAGE_TAG=latest
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12:${IMAGE_TAG}
```

```bash
# Dev build
docker build --build-arg IMAGE_TAG=debug -t myapp:dev .

# Production build
docker build -t myapp:prod .
```

### Strategy 2: Kubernetes Ephemeral Containers

If you're running on Kubernetes (v1.23+), you can use **ephemeral containers** — a sidecar container with debugging tools that gets injected alongside your running distroless container:

```bash
# Inject a debug container into the running pod
kubectl debug -it my-pod \
  --image=busybox:latest \
  --target=my-container

# Now you have a shell that shares the process namespace
# You can see your app's processes, files, and network
```

This is the **recommended** approach in Kubernetes because:
- Your production image stays untouched (no debug tools shipped)
- You only get debugging access when you explicitly ask for it
- The ephemeral container is destroyed when you detach

### Strategy 3: Enhanced Logging

The veteran Docker engineer's answer to "how do I debug distroless?" is often: **"You shouldn't need to shell in."**

Instead, build your application with rich, structured logging:

```python
import logging
import json

# Structured JSON logging — readable without a shell
logging.basicConfig(
    format='{"timestamp":"%(asctime)s","level":"%(levelname)s","message":"%(message)s"}',
    level=logging.INFO
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Server started on port 8080")
```

```bash
# View logs without exec-ing in
docker logs my-container
docker logs my-container --follow --tail 100
```

---

## 13. Available Distroless Base Images

### Google Distroless Images

| Image | Use Case | What's Included |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12` | Go, Rust, C (static binaries) | CA certs, tzdata only |
| `gcr.io/distroless/base-debian12` | C/C++ apps needing glibc | + glibc, libssl, openssl |
| `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12` | C++ apps needing libstdc++ | + libstdc++ |
| `gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12` | Python applications | + Python runtime |
| `gcr.io/distroless/java21-debian12` | Java applications | + JRE 21 |
| `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian12` | Node.js applications | + Node.js 20 runtime |

### Chainguard Images

| Image | Use Case | Key Difference |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `cgr.dev/chainguard/static` | Static binaries | Wolfi-based (not Debian) |
| `cgr.dev/chainguard/python` | Python apps | Updated more frequently |
| `cgr.dev/chainguard/php` | PHP apps | Non-root by default |
| `cgr.dev/chainguard/jre` | Java apps | Minimal JRE |
| `cgr.dev/chainguard/node` | Node.js apps | Hardened defaults |

> **Tip:** Every Chainguard image has a `-dev` variant (e.g., `python:latest-dev`) for the build stage, and a non-`-dev` variant for production.

## 15. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Using Shell Form in ENTRYPOINT/CMD

```dockerfile
# ❌ WILL CRASH — distroless has no /bin/sh
CMD python app.py

# ✅ Use exec form
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Pitfall 2: Shell Scripts as Entrypoints

```dockerfile
# ❌ WILL CRASH — can't execute shell scripts without a shell!
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

# ✅ Either bake the logic into your app or use exec form directly
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/main.py"]
```

If you absolutely need startup logic, do it in your application code (e.g., read env vars in Python/Java), not in a shell script.

### Pitfall 3: Expecting `docker exec` to Work

```bash
# ❌ No shell exists
docker exec -it container sh

# ✅ Use the :debug variant, or Kubernetes ephemeral containers
```

### Pitfall 4: Forgetting CA Certificates

If your app makes HTTPS requests, it needs CA certificates. All distroless images include them, but if you build a truly `FROM scratch` image, you'll need to copy them manually:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=build /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
```

### Pitfall 5: File Permissions

Distroless images (especially Chainguard's) run as **non-root** by default. If you `COPY` files as root, the app user might not be able to read them:

```dockerfile
# ✅ Set correct ownership
COPY --chown=nonroot:nonroot --from=build /app /app
USER nonroot
```

---

## 16. Distroless in Production: A Complete Example

Let's put it all together with a production-grade Go microservice:

```dockerfile
# ─── Stage 1: Build ─────────────────────────────────
FROM golang:1.22-bookworm AS build

WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 \
    go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /server ./cmd/server

# ─── Stage 2: Production ────────────────────────────
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12

# Copy the binary
COPY --from=build /server /server

# Copy config files if needed
COPY --from=build /app/configs /configs

# Run as non-root (UID 65534 = "nobody")
USER nonroot:nonroot

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# Exec form — app is PID 1, receives signals directly
ENTRYPOINT ["/server"]
```

```bash
# Build
docker build -t myservice:v1.0.0 .

# Check the image size
docker images myservice
# REPOSITORY   TAG      SIZE
# myservice    v1.0.0   8.2MB   ← 🎉

# Run
docker run -p 8080:8080 myservice:v1.0.0

# Attempt to shell in (will fail — by design!)
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
# OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process:
# exec: "sh": executable file not found in $PATH
```

---

## 17. Summary: When to Use Distroless

| Scenario | Use Distroless? | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Production microservices | ✅ **Yes** | Security + size reduction |
| CI/CD build containers | ❌ No | You need build tools, shells, package managers |
| Development environments | ❌ No | You need to debug interactively |
| Staging environments | 🟡 Maybe | Use `:debug` tag for the best of both worlds |
| Open-source library containers | ✅ **Yes** | Minimize supply chain attack surface |
| Batch jobs / cron containers | ✅ **Yes** | Run once, exit — no shell needed |

### The Golden Rules

1. **Build in Stage 1, Run in Stage 2.** Never ship build tools to production.
2. **Always use exec form** `["..."]` — never shell form.
3. **Use `:debug` tags** in staging, standard tags in production.
4. **Invest in structured logging** instead of relying on `docker exec`.
5. **Run as non-root** — distroless makes this easy (and many variants enforce it).

Distroless images represent a fundamental shift in how we think about containers. Instead of asking *"what should we add to make this work?"*, they ask *"what can we remove and still have it work?"*

The answer, it turns out, is almost everything. Your app doesn't need `bash`. It doesn't need `curl`. It doesn't need `apt-get`. It just needs the Kernel and the libraries to talk to it.

Once you internalize that — that the Shell was always just a convenience for humans, not a requirement for machines — distroless stops feeling weird and starts feeling obvious.

Build heavy. Ship light. Sleep well. 🛡️
